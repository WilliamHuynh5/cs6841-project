## Overview

Our Minecraft hacked client was a sophisticated and comprehensive endeavor aimed at redefining the gameplay experience and introducing a novel perspective to the world of Minecraft hacking. As passionate Minecraft players and computer science enthusiasts, we embarked on this project with the aim of unraveling the intricacies of Mojang's acclaimed game, viewing it through a security-oriented lens. Our journey led us to delve deeply into the game's architecture, allowing us to dissect its underlying code structure and gain valuable insights into its fundamental mechanics. Through this process, we not only identified potential vulnerabilities within the game's codebase but also gained a profound understanding of how to exploit these weaknesses to create our hacked client.

## Key Features

Our hacked client incorporated a range of innovative features, each designed to enhance the gameplay experience:
